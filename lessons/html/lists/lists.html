<h1>List Practice</h1>
<p>To get some practice using lists, create a new HTML document and create the following lists:</p>
<ol>
    <li>An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods</li>
    <li>An ordered list of todo’s you need to get done today</li>
    <li>An unordered list of places you’d like to visit someday</li>
    <li>An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies</li>
</ol>
<!-- Lists cannot be nested inside paragraphs, according to the HTML 5 spec. 
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p (see Tag Omission)
    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element

    There is currently no accepted way to code lists that logically belong within a paragraph.
    Best bet is prob to wrap the set in a <div> element, and apply suitable styling with CSS:
        <div class="paragraph_with_list">
            <p>This paragraph's parent element contains the following child elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A paragraph</li>
                <li>An ordered list</li>
                <li>A second paragraph</li>
            </ol>
            <p>which allows us to pretend we've nested the list inside a single paragraph.</p>
        </div>

<h2>Places to Visit</h2>
<ul type="square" compact><!-- 
    The TYPE and COMPACT attributes for unordered lists are both deprecated. 
    Use the CSS list-style-type property instead.

    <li>Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota</li>

<ol type="I" reversed><!-- 
    The TYPE attribute for ordered lists is different than the one for unordered.
    Unless the type of the list number matters (like legal or technical documents where items are referenced by their number/letter), use the CSS list-style-type property instead.

<h2>Description List</h2>
<!-- https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/#description-lists -->
<dl>
    <!-- the description list requires two block-level elements: 
         the description term element, <dt>, and the description element, <dd> -->
    <dt>study</dt>
    <dd>The devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by means of books</dd>

    <!-- A single term may have multiple meanings and warrant multiple descriptions. -->
    <dt>design</dt>
    <dd>A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is built or made</dd>
    <dd>Purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object</dd>

    <!-- Conversely, a single description may be suitable for multiple terms. -->
    <dt>business</dt>
    <dt>work</dt>
    <dd>A person's regular occupation, profession, or trade</dd>
